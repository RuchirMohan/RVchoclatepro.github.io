    <p>Our 'SWEET' Story - TWO generations of Chocolatiers
        It all started with ONE retail store, a candy stove and a young candy maker.
        The Abel Family
        After years of studying the art of handcrafting small batches of premium chocolates, founder Dan Abel came back to his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri to open his own candy company. His creations were the result of years of apprenticing with master candy makers across the country. In February of 1981, the young candy maker opened his first Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Company store with his wife Rosalie. The name "Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate" was named for the founder's three children.
        
        Today, Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Company is an award-winning 2nd generation chocolate company. Co-founders Dan and Rosalie are joined by their three children, Christina, Dan Jr., and Christopher. At the heart of the company is a family of candy makers who work alongside a talented staff of artisan chocolatiers with over 100 years of combined confectionery experience. Original recipes from the turn of the century are slowly cooked into copper kettles and stirred by hand. Chocolates are hand decorated one by one, with precise attention to detail. Our team sources the globe for world-class ingredients and maintains a minimum standard of Fair Trade Certified™ for our chocolate and sugar. We use only real butter, Fresh Whipping Cream, Cane Sugar, Natural Flavors & Fruits, Premium Nuts and RSPO Palm Oil.
